## 1. Overview

**Purpose:**  
RentBot simplifies and automates communication between small landlords and tenants. It helps landlords manage rental inquiries, FAQs, and rent-related follow-ups ‚Äî without switching between texts, emails, or calls.

**Vision:**  
Build an **AI-powered communication assistant** that helps landlords with 2‚Äì10 rental units handle tenant messages efficiently ‚Äî reducing missed leads and saving hours each week.

**Goal for MVP:**  
Launch a minimal, working product that handles **automated inquiry responses and appointment scheduling** via SMS and email ‚Äî integrated with landlords‚Äô existing tools (Google Calendar, Gmail, or Outlook).

---

## 2. Target Users

**Primary User:**  
Independent landlords or small property owners managing **2‚Äì10 residential units**.

**User Characteristics:**
- Handles communication manually (texts, calls, emails)  
- Juggles property management with a full-time job  
- Loses time answering repetitive questions (rent amount, availability, pets, etc.)  
- May not use advanced tools like AppFolio or Buildium due to cost/complexity  

---

## 3. Problem Statement

Small landlords lose money and time due to poor communication systems:
- Missed inquiries ‚Üí lost tenants ‚Üí vacancy cost ($2K+/month)  
- Delayed responses ‚Üí bad tenant experience  
- No unified inbox or automation ‚Üí manual chaos  

**Solution:**  
RentBot acts as a virtual assistant ‚Äî automating repetitive communication through SMS, email, and (later) WhatsApp.
